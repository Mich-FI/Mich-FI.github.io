I am a student of University of Jyväskylä and I study computer science as my bachelor’s there. The direct interest and focus that I have is for cybersecurity, and more specifically security analysis and penetration testing.

I’m a very adaptable person. In any new situation, I can quickly pick up signs and behaviours to understand what’s going on, keep calm and act fast. Even if I don’t have all the information, I can start with something rather than be paralyzed until I’m perfectly comfortable with the situation I’m in. Another strength that I have is my written and verbal communication. As a social person, I can approach anyone, in-person or digitally, and say what I have on my mind and communicate it clearly. I feel like I am also easy to talk to since I like to be open myself and listen to people carefully when they are talking. Finally, I’ve learned a lot of programming in my studies inside and outside of my university courses. I’ve coded in languages such as C#, Java, Python and Lisp Scheme,  and I’ve done database creation and querying in SQL.

Protecting and helping people is really valuable to me. One of the main reasons that I want to be an exceptional cybersecurity professional is because I want to be able to protect as many people as I can in a rapidly digitally evolving world. This includes securing for example software, networks, websites and everyday-devices. This is what I see as doing the right thing. Even if on some days I am not feeling so energetic, I know it is right to learn about the current threats and make sure that the security of what I am responsible for is extremely high-quality. As long as I am improving and being better than my yesterday’s self, I will keep learning and practicing.

What most interests me about the field of cybersecurity is finding vulnerabilities before black hat hackers do, being one of the best in the field by knowing how computers and networks work down to the bits so that I can strongly secure them, and analyzing suspicious activity and acting accordingly meaning by the playbook as well as lawfully and ethically.

The strengths, values and interests that I have align strongly with what is needed in the field of cybersecurity and as I keep learning and practicing the skills in this field, the more competent I become. My interests, skills and goals are fully within this field which is why I am a great candidate for anyone who is looking for knowledgeable and driven cybersecurity professionals.
